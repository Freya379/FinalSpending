# Personal Cash Inflow/Outflow Record System (Fullstack)

This project is a personal cash inflow and outflow recording system. It allows users to log in and record their spending and income. All data is stored in a MongoDB database, and users can add, edit, or delete records through the web interface.
Developers can interact with the database directly from the terminal. The front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end uses MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and handles user sessions with tokens.
